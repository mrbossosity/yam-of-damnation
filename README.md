# yam-of-damnation
my personal website, where i plan to store (for purpose of documentation/archiving) my video, music, meme, and text projects, primarily from summer 2020. 
thank you to bill wurtz for inspiring me to do this. it's nice to have all the stuff you're proud (and horrifed at) in one place.
