<p>my personal website, where i plan to store (for purposes of documentating/archiving) my video, music, meme, and text projects, primarily from summer 2020.</p>
<p>thank you to bill wurtz for inspiring me to do this. it's nice to have all the stuff you're proud of (and horrifed at) in one place.</p>
